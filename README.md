# Module-05-Project-05

In this class stack_list, it copied from the module 4 homework with some specific modifications to it.
the 'LinkedList<Integer>' was commented out then replaced with 'Stack<Integer>' so the input would be placed in a stack.
In the while loop that take the user input, I commented out the 'num_list.add(number_input)' then replaced it with 'num_list.push(number_input)' so the stack can receive inputs.
I kept the Collections.sort(num_list) since it still sorted the stack.

To run the class, you need enter in the command line 'java stack_list.java' while in the directory containing the java file 'stack_list.java' 

To get the Javadoc of the class, you need enter in the command line 'javadoc stack_list.java' while in the directory containing the java file 'stack_list.java'
